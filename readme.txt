== Description ==
Ali Blank is the definitive WordPress HTML5 boilerplate starter theme.

We've carefully constructed the most clean and minimalist theme possible for designers and developers to use as a base to build websites for clients or to build completely custom themes from scratch. Clean, simple, unstyled, semi-minified, unformatted, and valid code, SEO-friendly, jQuery-enabled, standardized and as white label as possible, and most importantly, the CSS is reset for cross-browser-compatability and no intrusive visual CSS styles have been added whatsoever. A perfect skeleton theme. For support and suggestions, go to: https://github.com/AliSal92/ali-blank/issues. Thank you.

If you're creating your own theme or client project, open up all files and do a "Find and Replace All in All Files" on the word "ali-blank" with your own slug and prefix.
